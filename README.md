# Customer Segmentation & House Price Prediction
This project includes two major data science tasks:
1. **House Price Prediction using Linear Regression**
2.  **Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering**
   
## 🏠 Task 01: House Price Prediction (Linear Regression)
**Dataset**: [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
### Objective
Predict house sale prices based on features like:
- **GrLivArea** – Above ground living area in square feet
- **BedroomAbvGr** – Number of bedrooms
- **FullBath** – Number of full bathrooms
### Steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Train-test split.
- Linear regression model fitting.
- Model evaluation using:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R-squared score
- Actual vs Predicted Price scatter plot.

## 📊 Task 02: Customer Segmentation (K-means Clustering)
**Dataset**: [Mall Customers Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
### Objective
Group retail store customers into clusters based on:
- **Annual Income (k$)**
- **Spending Score (1-100)**
### Steps
- Data visualization using seaborn/matplotlib.
- Elbow method to determine optimal number of clusters.
- K-means clustering to assign each customer to a group.
- Scatter plot of customer segments.
🧠 Skills Covered
