# House Price Prediction & Customer Segmentation
This project includes two major data science tasks:
1. **House Price Prediction using Linear Regression**
2.  **Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering**
   
## 🏠 Task 01: House Price Prediction (Linear Regression)
**Dataset**: [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
### 📌 Objective
Predict house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms using Linear Regression.
- Features used:
  - `GrLivArea` (Above ground living area)
  - `BedroomAbvGr`
  - `FullBath`
  - `SalePrice` (Target Variable)
  ### 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
### Steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Train-test split.
- Linear regression model fitting.
- Model evaluation using:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R-squared score
- Actual vs Predicted Price scatter plot.
  ### 📈 Sample Output
- Regression Line Plot
- Evaluation Metrics (e.g., R², MAE)
  
## 📊 Task 02: Customer Segmentation (K-means Clustering)
**Dataset**: [Mall Customers Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
### 📌 Objective
Group customers into segments based on their annual income and spending score using K-Means Clustering.
- Features used:
  - `Annual Income (k$)`
  - `Spending Score (1-100)`
### 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
### 🔎 Workflow
1. Data preprocessing and exploration
2. Choosing optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method
3. Clustering using K-Means
4. Visualization of customer segments
5. Basic insights from clusters
### 📈 Sample Output
- Elbow Curve Plot
- 2D Cluster Visualization
- Cluster-wise Customer Insights (e.g., high spenders, low income)
💡 Key Learnings
- Implemented supervised learning with Linear Regression.
- Gained insights into unsupervised learning with K-Means.
- Visualized data distributions and model outcomes.
- Learned to evaluate models with relevant metrics.
